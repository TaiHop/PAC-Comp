PAC-Comp
A repository that houses my comp experiment 

Description of Project

For my project I am creating a scraping tool that will collect its data from the PAC website. Initially I am starting with baseball only with expansion to the other sports to be added later. The reason I am doing this experiment is to address ... The final outcome I expect to have a scraping tool that will collect stats from the PAC website automatically, making data access and findability of the stats easier because it will all be in one dataset.

Tools:
Beautifulsoup
Python
Selenium (python tool)
